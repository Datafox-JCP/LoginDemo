# LoginDemo
## Login app screen
###### Evaluation of coding skills for job application

> We would like to understand a few things about your approach to code, projects, and the way you build them.

1. The given UI must be implemented using SwiftUI
2. The inputs fields should not be empty
3. Validations for email (must be a valid email)
4. Validations for password (should have 8 characters, 1 number, 1 upper case alphabet, 1 lower case alphabet)
5. Validations for username (should not have spaces and no upper case alphabet)
6. The app must be responsive for all devices (iPhone SE, iPhone 13, iPad)

ðŸ“Œ Use MVVM approach

ðŸ“Œ Reuse input fields using EntryField file

ðŸ“Œ Use of Combine for handle conditions

ðŸ“Œ Use of RegEx for handle restrictions and Extensions file code for triming spaces in username field

ðŸ“Œ Instructions are hidden when the validation is passed

ðŸ“Œ Login button only activates if all conditions are complete
